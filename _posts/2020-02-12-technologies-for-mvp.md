Technologies evolve rapidly. Hence, there are myriad available options in terms of programming languages, frameworks, tools, etc., that helps you build MVP faster, albeit complicates the choice at the same time. What may help a lot with that choice is to devise the high-level guiding rules beforehand and stick to them during the market research.

Engineers strive to build a solid foundation for the scalable platform from the very beginning. That is our natural desire to build cool stuff and grow as a professional. But that is an MVP! At this stage, there are plenty of hypotheses that need to be validated, changed, and replaced many times to find its place in the sun. And to increase the chances of success, **a startup has to move quickly and on the cheap**. In other words, engineers do have to be eager to build a solid foundation for the product unless it affects speed and costs. Or else, the startup may run out of money and enthusiasm much faster than it finds its customers. (The software development strategy for startups describes that in more detail.)

Taking that into consideration, **the proper order of criteria on the MVP stage** is following - choose technologies that:

* Allow to build MVP super **fast**;
* Are **cheap** to use, host and maintain;
* Are **flexible** in developing and scaling;
* There are **plenty of engineers** around willing to work with them.

And here are some **additional advice** for making that choice:

* Research available ready to use services, solutions, frameworks, and apply them whenever possible. That is the fastest way to pilot your hypothesis. So do that even if you are not going to use those tools in the long term perspective.
	
* Prefer to use what your team already knows. Again, that will speed up the market research.
	
* Try to minimize the number of used technologies, if possible.  Many tools and approaches complicate the solution and slow down the development.

### Summary:

For sure, some technologies better suits your requirements and more beneficial in the long term perspective. But bad tech decisions on the MVP stage is a problem you can fix later, even if those fixes may be expensive. Not having customers is an issue that you cannot postpone. Thus, chase fast and cheap ways to build MVP and research the market.
