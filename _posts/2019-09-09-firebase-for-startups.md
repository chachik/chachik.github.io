As a serverless platform, **Firebase** provides a wast set of tools that speed up the product launch and market research while saving limited resources at the beginning. Thus, that is an excellent choice on the **Seed** stage.

And after finding the niche and starting growing, there are **two possible strategies** to follow:
1. Gradually migrating into a more predictable and controlled backend infrastructure to mitigate high-costs risks.

2. Continue using Firebase with additional measures:
    * Make sure that you understand the price calculation policy and keep watching its changes; 

    * Budget growing costs with a risk buffer;

    * Thoroughly test the efficiency of client-to-server, server-to-server communications, as even a small bug can lead to useless data transferring loops and exponential growth of costs.
    
    * Still, use option one if your platform works with photo and video content.
