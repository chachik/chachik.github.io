						<p>I highly recommend ENFORS for startups. We had the opportunity to work together on the development of our digital car service. ENFORS came in late, with the goal to help us improve the quality of our outsourced development team. We saw immediate results. They helped us better structure the development process, facilitate the developers' understanding of our demands, reduce the frequency of bugs, and improve the quality of the platform. ENFORS is a very reliable partner with extensive experience and sharp minds. I am looking forward to continue our collaboration.</p>

						<p>It’s been a pleasure to collaborate with ENFORS on numerous projects. Each time, they managed to effortlessly blend into the product team, providing effective support across various stages of the product lifecycle - research, product conceptualisation, technology advisory, architecture, or hands-on development. ENFORS contributes with professionalism, speed, quality, responsibility, and top notch expertise. I look forward to expanding our collaboration with ENFORS across more projects and can strongly recommend their expertise to start-ups and established companies alike.</p>

						<p>Like in any startups there are plenty of things which have to be done simultaneously whilst resources are lean and limited. And this is exactly where ENFORS helped us to distill what is important at the current stage, narrowed a focus of the CTO mindset on the most vital tactic and strategic aspects of technological development which, in turn, streamlined an overall business pace. Besides, ENFORS as a hub of talented professionals in a software development domain helped us to strengthen our team with experienced engineers, precisely matching startups speed and spirit.</p>
